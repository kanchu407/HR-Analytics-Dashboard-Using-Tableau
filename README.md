# What about Human Resource(HR) Dashboards?
Human resources (HR) dashboards aggregate and present employee data in a meaningful way, and are designed to help make the most of everyone’s time, both within the HR team and throughout the entire organization. As a visual display of key metrics, HR dashboards simplify information gathering, and present data in a way that can be sorted, analyzed, and presented to management and executive teams.

A visually engaging way to track vital data, HR dashboards add value by measuring progress, nurturing relationships, and building culture and support:

Monitoring and Management:-  Regular reporting enables HR to accurately take the pulse of the organization by tracking key workforce metrics. HR pros can address emerging problems before they significantly impact the business and share victories as they occur.

Drill-Down Ability:-  Dig into data to uncover the root causes of issues like high turnover in specific departments, the cost of hiring for particular positions, or link retention of high performers to particular benefits or other factors  

Data-Driven Decision Making:-  Spot trends and understand challenges and opportunities — based on real data — that you can share with management.

Improved Hiring Processes:-  Savvy recruitment analytics saves both time and money by helping managers make informed talent decisions or assess employees’ performance more objectively when evaluating staff for promotions.

Onboarding:-  Improve retention and productivity with an onboarding process strengthened by dashboards. Track the delivery of electronic documents, new hire orientation and compliance processes, and job-specific training or other important steps as you get new team members up to speed.
